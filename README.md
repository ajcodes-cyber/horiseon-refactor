# Horiseon Refactor 

## Description

The purpose of this project is to refactor the codebase in order to adhere to accessibility standards. We also want the codebase to perform well with search engine optimization. This will be accomplished by editing the semantic HTML elements so that the browser can clearly understand what the content is.

## Goal of Project
### User Story

AS a marketing agency I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines

### Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

* WHEN I view the source code THEN I find semantic HTML elements

* WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

* WHEN I view the image elements THEN I find accessible alt attributes

* WHEN I view the heading attributes THEN they fall in sequential order

* WHEN I view the title element THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
